# Advent of Code 2023

## What's this?

I am challenging myself to do the AoC puzzles using Fortran.
In each folder inside `days/` there is a subfolder with the day it represents.
It contains the code, input and the readme of the puzzle.

## Why?

I wanted do do AoC for the first time, and using Python or JS didn't sound fun..

## Running solutions

1. Install the fortran compiler (gfortran).
2. `gfortran -o <binary_name> <source_file.f90>`
3. `./<binary_name>`
